# Glyph - Puzzle & Puzzle Hunt Application

Glyph is an application designed to host and manage puzzles and puzzle hunt competitions effectively
and easily.

Glyph exists to help puzzle & puzzle hunt maintainers easily run their events and interact with
participants through a slew of features, some of which are listed below.

* Staged & scheduled releases of certain puzzles and challenges to advance a hunt
* Built-in leaderboards with dynamic points systems to let you design your hunts as desired
* Communication tools such as email & social media integration to provide feedback to hunters

Glyph represents mainly the backend API that powers and stores the data. It aims to be front-end
agnostic, and the community provides a few different options for viable front-ends and integrations.

Please [read the documentation][rtd] for more project information and usage guides.
